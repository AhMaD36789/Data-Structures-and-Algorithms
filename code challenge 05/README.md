# Singly Linked List Implementation

This is a simple implementation for a linked list where the addition is always at the begining of the list

## approach and efficiency

time complexity for addition O(1)

time complexity for searching O(n)

time complexity for making a string with all the contents of the list O(n)

space complexity for the entire project O(n)

## solution
